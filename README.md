I developed the Make-a-building Game-2D using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. With the help of HTML structure and a title for the game. with the help of div I was created a total 25 slider. and with the help of button you can stop it. In CSS section, we will give styling to the html elements by using tag name or class name. And using flex box give responsiveness. In the JavaScript section, I have add some animation and also apply some events also on the button to stop a slider. If player adjust one slider then other slider come but there size was decreased this effect add using JavaScript and if player is not adjust slider in properly then game was over and scored was display on the screen. On the play button click, the game will start again
